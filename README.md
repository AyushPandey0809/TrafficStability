# TrafficStability
This repository contains the code for plotting figures in the paper "Asymptotic stability in a bathtub model".

## ODEplots
The folder **ODEplots** jupyter notebooks used to create plots in Sections 3-6. The notebooks are named as *plot_xx.ipynb*, where *xx* is the model name, i.e., *plot_kA.ipynb* has the code for the kA-model. The folder also contains *plots_functions.py* which has defines the variables and functions used in all the models.

## TripBasedSimulations
The folder **TripBasedSimulations** contains the notebooks to run simulations and create plots for section 7. The notebooks are named as *simulation_correct_xx-interrupts.ipynb*, where *xx* is the model name, i.e., *simulation_correct_kA.ipynb* has code for the kA-model. The folder also contains *simulation_functions.py* which has defines the variables and functions used in all the models.
